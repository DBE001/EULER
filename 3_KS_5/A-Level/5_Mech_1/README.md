# A-Level Mechanics 1

The schemes of work for A-level Mechanics Module One at Newstead Wood School.

## Overview

The lessons are arranged in book order but can be taught in alternative orders depending on the preferance of the teacher.

## Lessons

* [Modelling](https://github.com/DBE001/EULER/tree/main/3_KS_5/A-Level/5_Mech_1/08_Modelling) : 2 lessons.
* [Constant-Acceleration](https://github.com/DBE001/EULER/tree/main/3_KS_5/A-Level/5_Mech_1/09_Constant_Acceleration) : 5 lessons.
* [Forces-and-Motion](https://github.com/DBE001/EULER/tree/main/3_KS_5/A-Level/5_Mech_1/10_Forces_Motion) : 7 lessons.
* [Variable Acceleration](https://github.com/DBE001/EULER/tree/main/3_KS_5/A-Level/5_Mech_1/11_Variable_Acceleration) : 6 lessons.

## Information

These lessons can be done in book order but the following order works well to emphasize the role of forces at the heart of mechanics.

### Alternative

* Forces, with modelling covered as it arises, and suvat questions skipped over so that the connection between force and acceleration is front and centre.
* Constant acceleration follwed by variable acceleration to give kinematics a single cohesive approach.
